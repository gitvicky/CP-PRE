This folder contains the initial experiments in evaluating the CP framework within the Residual Space. 
The experiments were mainly characterised by an FNO/U-Net that models single-pred/AR manner the evolution of a PDE. 
Across the range of experiments had varing T_in, step and T_out. With the calibration and prediction obtained from previously saved datasets. 
Residuals are estimated using FD Stencils as Conv. Kernels.
